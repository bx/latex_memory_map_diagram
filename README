These files help automate the process of drawing memory map diagrams
using tikz in LaTeX.

_INSTALLATION_

- Copy generate_mem_diagram.py into /usr/local/bin
- Copy mem_diagram.sty into the the same directory as the LaTeX file
from which you want to include a memory diagram.
- Include the mem_diagram package in your LaTeX source -- \includepackage{mem_diagram}


_BUILD_
- latex/pdflatex must be run with the --shell-escape option
- In your LaTeX source, use the \memdiagram command at the location in which you want to draw the diagram

\memdiagram[scaling factor]{path/to/csv}


_MEMORY MAP CSV STRUCTURE_

Each line in the csv file that defines the memory map must start with
one of the following keywords:

node, regionlabel, multiregionlabel, config

Lines that start with the 'node' keyword define a region of
memory. They must have 6 comma separated values as follows:

node, {KIND}, {min address}, {max address}, {ID}, {CONTENTS}

-{KIND} can be one of: empty, regular, grow up heap, grow down stack
You can define more node KINDs via \tikzstyle.  For example, you can
define a node for registers and how it looks in your LaTeX file like:
\tikzstyle{registers} = [dotted, very thick, pattern=crosshatch dots gray,
    fill opacity=1, text opacity=1]
- {min address} and {max address} are the minimum and maximum address
values for the region
- {ID} is a unique identifier used to refer to the region if labeled.
It can be left empty.
- {CONTENTS} is text to be written inside that particular node's box. It
can be left empty.

Lines that start with 'regionlabel' indicate that a particular region
should be annotated with a label. Its syntax is

regionlabel, {ID}, {CONTENTS}

-{ID} is the ID of the node to be labeled
-{CONTENTS} is the label itself

Lines that start with 'multiregionlabel' indicate that a consecutive
group of regions should be annotated with a label. Its syntax is

multiregionlabel, {ID TOP}, {ID BOTTOM}, {CONTENTS}

-{ID TOP} is the ID of the top-most node to be labeled
-{ID BOTTOM} is the ID of the top-most node to be labeled
-{CONTENTS} is the label itself

I will not be defining the 'config' keyword at this time


_EVERYTHING ELSE_

See the example/ subdirectory for example usage.

generate_mem_diagram.py is not meant for standalone use, it is invoked
via \memdiagram in LaTeX

I will not be documenting update_csv_group.py at this time, but I did
find it useful when tweaking values and 'config' keyworks in groups of
csv files
